To be able to manage your database in DBeaver, you need to create a connection to this database â€“ see [Creating Connections](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Creating-Connections). A connection includes a driver and a number of configuration parameters including the location of the database and credentials to access it.  You need to create a separate connection to every database you want to manage. Every database type requires its own set of connection parameters.

Connections reside in the Database Navigator and in the Projects view. In these views, you can:
* Edit connections, see [Editing Connections](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Editing-Connections)
* Rename and delete connections - via corresponding context menu items, see [Database Navigator](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Navigator)
