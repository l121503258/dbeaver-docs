The navigation pane on the left displays configuration sections, most of which are the same as those in the Create new connection wizard, see [Conecting to Databases](https://github.com/serge-rider/dbeaver/wiki/Connecting-to-Databases). There are additional configuration sections as well, such as **Result Sets** and **SQL Editor**. Click the section name to open the configuration settings for editing.

You can test if your connection works with modified settings - click **Test Connection**. When you finish editing your conneciton, click **OK** to save the changes or **Cancel** to discard them.
