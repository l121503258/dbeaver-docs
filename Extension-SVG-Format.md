This extension supports data export in Office formats (XLS).

It is included in EE version.

### Installation in CE version:
1. Main menu `Help -> Install New Software`
2. Install Office extension. You can do this from online Eclipse Marketplace (https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/dbeaver-svg-support). Or you can do this manually:
  * Paste `https://dbeaver.jkiss.org/update/svg/latest/` into `Work with` field and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
  * Check `DBeaver Extension->DBeaver Office Extension` item  
4. Click Next->Finish. Restart DBeaver.

Note: this works only if DBeaver version matches Office extension version (e.g. latest).
