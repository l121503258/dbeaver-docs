***Scripts***

To open SQL editor for some connection select this connection in the Database Navigator view and press F3 (you can do the same from context menu or main menu). DBeaver opens popup window with SQL scripts linked to this connection. If you need to create new SQL script press "New Script" in that popup or click on "New SQL Editor" on the main toolbar. 

You can open the most recent SQL editor using <kbd>CTRL+Enter</kbd> shortcut in the Database Navigator view.

You can see all your SQL scripts in the Project Explorer view folder “Scripts”. You can organize your scripts in folders, reassign database connections for particular scripts in the same Project Explorer view. 
DBeaver uses SQL syntax highlighting which depends on database associated with a script. Different databases have different sets of reserved keywords, system functions. 

***Import/export scripts***

***Execute queries***

There are a few ways to execute a query:
- Standard query execute (<kbd>CTRL+ENTER</kbd>). Executes SQL query under cursor or selected text and fills results panel with query results.
- Execute in a separate tab (<kbd>CTRL+\ </kbd>). Similar to standard but creates new results tab.
- Execute a script (<kbd>ALT+X</kbd>). Executes all queries in current editor (or selected queries) as a script. DBeaver parses queries one by one using statements delimiter (“;” by default) and execute them consequently. Script execution behaviour can be configured in SQL editor preferences.
- Execute a script opening each query results in a separate tab (<kbd>CTRL+ALT+X</kbd>). The same as script execution but opens multiple result tabs. Each script query will be executed in a separate thread (i.e. all queries are executed simultaneously). Be careful with this feature – if you’ll execute a huge script with big number of queries it may lead to unexpected problems. 

***Execution plan***

If database driver supports execution plan visualization then you can see execution plan of current query (under cursor) by pressing <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+E</kbd> (or clicking on “Explain execution plan” in context menu or editor toolbar).  

***Query Parameters***

Dynamic parameters bindings. You can use dynamic parameters in your SQL queries. Parameter format :name. When you execute a query which contains dynamic parameters DBeaver will popup dialog where you can fill parameters’ values. Also you can use anonymous parameters (?) but you will need to enable them in SQL editor preferences.  

***Auto-complete***

To perform some object name auto-complete press <kbd>CTRL+SPACE</kbd>. DBeaver searches for possible completions objects in already loaded database metadata and in database system tables. Also DBeaver completes SQL keywords. Another auto-complete function is <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE</kbd>, it searches for completion only within already entered identifiers.  

***Miscellaneous***

Select of current query row count can be performed by pressing <kbd>CTRL+ALT+C</kbd>.  

You can directly export current query results to a file/table by clicking on “Export From Query” in the context menu. This feature is useful if you have some very long-running query and you don’t need to see it’s results in results panel.  

Execution Log tab contains all queries executed in current SQL editor. You can configure Query Manager settings in global preferences.

Output tab contains all server-side database messages/warnings generated by a database when you execute queries. This feature supported only by a few database engines (Oracle, SQL Server and some other). 

To open current object (under cursor) definition press <kbd>F4</kbd>.  
Hyperlinks: you can press CTRL and move mouse over SQL text. If DBeaver will recognize some identifier as a table/view name then it will be presented as a hyperlink which will navigate to an object editor.  
SQL formatting. To format SQL text select it and press <kbd>CTRL+ALT+F</kbd>.

SQL editor preferences can be opened by pressing <kbd>ALT+ENTER</kbd>.

To toggle (hide/show) results panel press <kbd>F6</kbd>.
To maximize results panel press <kbd>SHIFT+F6</kbd> or double-click on results tab name.
To switch between editor and results panel press <kbd>ALT+F6</kbd>.

Active database/schema selection. To change connection associated with current SQL editor or change active database/schema use combo boxes in the main toolbar.

Transactions management. You can toggle auto-commit mode and transactions isolation level in the main toolbar or main menu “Database”.
